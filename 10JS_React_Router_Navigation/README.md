# Assignment - Navigation

0. ```npm install``` and ```npm run dev```

1. The goal was to build a website with React, where contact information of users are divided into separate "routes"/URL's. In addition, "parent-child" concept of Router is tested.

2. This specific assignment is part of a larger set, so no major description is given here.

3. Basically, the latest addition is an error page that is displayed with incorrect URL input:

    - Example: ```/users``` kind of route DOES NOT exist (```/contacts``` does)

2. (EXTRA) More definitive message:

    - In ```/contacts```, try ```/contacts/1000```

    - Error message notes that there is no user with this ID.
